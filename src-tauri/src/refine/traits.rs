//! The contract every text-refinement backend implements.
//!
//! # Why this is not `TranscriptionProvider`
//!
//! `blueprint.md` §7 is explicit: **the speech-to-text provider and the rewrite
//! provider are separate architectural concepts, and changing your STT model
//! must never implicitly change your rewrite model.** Reusing the transcription
//! trait here would collapse exactly that distinction.
//!
//! So this is its own small trait, its own registry, and its own setting. A
//! user can dictate with Groq and refine with Apple Intelligence, or dictate
//! locally and not refine at all.
