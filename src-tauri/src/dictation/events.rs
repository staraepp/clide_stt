//! The event contract between Rust and the UI.
//!
//! Two layers, on purpose:
//!
//! * `STATE` carries the whole `DictationState` and is what the UI actually
//!   renders from. One authoritative value means the interface cannot show a
//!   contradictory combination of flags.
//! * The lifecycle events mirror the pipeline stages for anything that needs
//!   to react to a specific moment (the HUD's success chime, a future menu-bar
//!   animation) without diffing state.
