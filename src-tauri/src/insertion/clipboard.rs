//! Every completed transcript is copied to the clipboard and left there. This
//! gives the user a reliable recovery path and prevents a slow target app from
//! missing a paste because Clide restored the previous contents too early.
//!
//! **All pasteboard access is serialised.** `NSPasteboard` maintains an
//! internal type cache that is not thread-safe: concurrent `types` calls
//! corrupt it and crash inside AppKit. Clide reaches the clipboard from the
//! insertion worker and from the Copy command, so every entry point goes
//! through [`access`], and the borrow-paste-restore sequence holds the lock
//! for its whole duration so nothing can interleave with it.
