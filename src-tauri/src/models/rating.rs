//! How well a model suits this machine.
//!
//! # Why these numbers are defensible
//!
//! Every score here is derived from something real: the model's declared speed
//! and quality class, its actual size on disk, and this Mac's measured memory
//! and chip. Nothing is invented, and nothing is a popularity score — Clide has
//! no telemetry and could not know one. A cloud model's speed rating reflects
//! its class, not a benchmark Clide has not run.
//!
//! `blueprint.md` and `AGENTS.md` both forbid inventing statistics. If a rating
//! cannot be derived from a measured or declared fact, it does not belong here.
